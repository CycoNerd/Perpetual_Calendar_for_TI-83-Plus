Hello, and welcome to my GitHub repository for a perpetual calendar program that runs on a TI-83 Plus.

After you download the CALENDAR.8xp file, you will need the following:
  1. Software that allows your computer to connect to a TI-83 Plus calculator (TI no longer supports this)
  2. A USB to TI-83 Plus link cable

You can find such a cable online at https://education.ti.com/en/products/accessories/silver-usb-cable.

If you don't already have the TI-Connect software, there are some open source alternatives:

  2. https://download.cnet.com/wabbitemu-ti-calculator-emulator-64-bit/3000-20417_4-77648094.html (this is just an emulator)

I made this program while in prison, referring to the perpetual calendar in the _World Almanac and Book of Facts_. I was lucky to have this TI-83 Plus calculator and wrote many programs on it.

Have fun!
